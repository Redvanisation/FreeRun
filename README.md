<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://tech--talks.herokuapp.com/)

This project is a **PROTOTYPE** of a real e-commerce that I have previously developed, it's a full-stack mobile responsive app with a **React** front-end and a **Ruby on Rails API** back-end with **AWS S3** for images' storage via **active storage**, it has a PayPal checkout integration and the cart is saved in the browser's local storage. This is the front-end repo and you could find the back-end code on [https://github.com/Redvanisation/FreeRunAPI](https://github.com/Redvanisation/FreeRunAPI).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

- On the website you will fin a list of products, as a **guest user** clicking on each product will take you to its page which has an **add to cart** button that adds the product to the cart if the stock is more than 0 and the button is visible.
- As a **regular user**(logged in user) by clicking on a product it would take you to its page which would have an additional **add to wishlist** button which would add the product to the user's wishlist where you can view or delete products from it.
- The **admin user** has the ability to add products from the menu bar, as well as updating or removing them (available from every single product's page).
- Once on the cart you can increase or decrease each product's quantity or remove it from the cart, you can also empty the whole cart or pay with the **PayPal checkout** button.
- By clicking the **PayPal checkout** button a window will pop-up that uses **PayPal sandbox** (mocking the real payment features) you can copy/paste the following credentials to test the payment functionality and how the app handles it:
 - PayPal Sandbox Email: `sb-3sfev1297483@personal.example.com`
 - PayPal Sandbox Password: `Vp?7l8an`
- After the payment you will be redirected to the home page and each quantity you bought will be deducted from the product's stock.
- As a **regular user** you will also have the ability to view your previous orders and the history of the purchased products in every order.
